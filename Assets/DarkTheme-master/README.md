Made by instance-id, https://gist.github.com/instance-id/3046ad29bd8782a3b3398cd9ae48ca92  
I just packaged it to try out Unity's new package system and hosting packages on github.

To use the package:
- Go to the Package Manager window
- Click the + button in the top left corner
- Click "Add package from git URL..."
- Enter https://github.com/PatHightree/DarkTheme.git
- Click Add
